## 🔴 Critical — Must Fix Before Mainnet

### GRAV-001 · Mint Precompile Wrong Authorized Address

**Repo:** `Galxe/gravity-reth`
**File:** `crates/pipe-exec-layer-ext-v2/execute/src/mint_precompile.rs`
**Risk:** Unlimited native G token minting by unauthorized caller

- [ ] **Identify the correct authorized caller address**
  - Confirm whether the authorized caller should be `JWK_MANAGER_ADDR` (`0x...1625f4001`) or a different system address
  - Cross-check with the smart contract deployment (`NativeOracle.sol`, `JWKManager.sol`)
  - Confirm with contract deployment team which address is actually calling the mint precompile at runtime

- [ ] **Replace hardcoded address with canonical constant**
  ```rust
  use super::onchain_config::JWK_MANAGER_ADDR;
  pub const AUTHORIZED_CALLER: Address = JWK_MANAGER_ADDR;
  ```

- [ ] **Add compile-time assertion**
  ```rust
  const _: () = assert!(AUTHORIZED_CALLER.0 == JWK_MANAGER_ADDR.0);
  ```

- [ ] **Add unit test**
  ```rust
  #[test]
  fn authorized_caller_matches_jwk_manager() {
      assert_eq!(AUTHORIZED_CALLER, JWK_MANAGER_ADDR);
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Audit testnet: verify no unauthorized minting occurred**
  - Check testnet state for unexpected G token supply changes
  - Confirm `0x595475934ed7d9faa7fca28341c2ce583904a44e` has not called the precompile

- [ ] **PR created and reviewed**
- [ ] **PR merged to `Galxe/gravity-reth` main**
- [ ] **gravity-testnet tag updated or new testnet deployment**

### GRAV-005 · ValidatorManagement Auto-Eviction Consensus Halt

**Repo:** `Galxe/gravity_chain_core_contracts`
**File:** `src/validator/ValidatorManagement.sol`
**Function:** `evictUnderperformingValidators()`
**Risk:** Zero active validators after epoch transition → consensus halt

- [ ] **Update `remainingActive` count to include `PENDING_INACTIVE`**
  ```solidity
  uint256 remainingActive = 0;
  for (uint256 j = 0; j < activeLen; j++) {
      ValidatorStatus s = _validators[_activeValidators[j]].status;
      if (s == ValidatorStatus.ACTIVE || s == ValidatorStatus.PENDING_INACTIVE) {
          remainingActive++;
      }
  }
  if (remainingActive <= 1) {
      break;
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Write unit test: eviction halts when only 1 ACTIVE + N PENDING_INACTIVE remain**

- [ ] **Write integration test: epoch transition with simultaneous `leaveValidatorSet()` + auto-eviction**

- [ ] **Verify the same fix is not needed in `processValidatorSetUpdates()` or other epoch-boundary functions**

- [ ] **PR created and reviewed**
- [ ] **PR merged to `Galxe/gravity_chain_core_contracts` main**
- [ ] **Redeploy contracts on testnet**

## 🟡 Medium — Fix Before External Audit Submission

### GRAV-002 · Unauthenticated `/set_failpoint` and `/mem_prof` on HTTP

**Repo:** `Galxe/gravity-sdk`
**File:** `crates/api/src/https/mod.rs`
**Risk:** Remote attacker disrupts validator operation by injecting fail-points

- [ ] **Decision: choose fix strategy**
  - [ ] Option A: Move to `https_routes` + add token auth middleware
  - [ ] Option B: Bind HTTP listener to `127.0.0.1` only
  - [ ] Option C: Gate behind `#[cfg(feature = "failpoints")]`, disabled in production

- [ ] **Implement chosen option**

- [ ] **Verify fail-point endpoints are not reachable from external network on testnet**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://<validator-external-ip>:8080/set_failpoint
  # Should return 403, 404, or connection refused
  ```

- [ ] **PR created and reviewed**
- [ ] **PR merged to `Galxe/gravity-sdk` main**

---

### GRAV-003 · SSRF in Sentinel Probe URL

**Repo:** `Galxe/gravity-sdk`
**File:** `bin/sentinel/src/probe.rs`
**Risk:** Attacker who modifies sentinel config can probe cloud metadata endpoints

- [ ] **Add URL validation at config load time**
  - Reject non-http/https schemes
  - Block link-local (`169.254.0.0/16`), loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`), and RFC 1918 private ranges
  - Log a hard error (not warning) if validation fails and refuse to start

- [ ] **Consider switching from arbitrary URL to predefined probe types** (e.g., enum: `rpc_health`, `p2p_port`, `consensus_api`) to eliminate the attack surface entirely

- [ ] **Update `sentinel.toml.example` and docs with guidance on URL allowlist**

- [ ] **PR created and reviewed**
- [ ] **PR merged to `Galxe/gravity-sdk` main**

---

### GRAV-004 · Consensus API Endpoints on Plaintext HTTP

**Repo:** `Galxe/gravity-sdk`
**File:** `crates/api/src/https/mod.rs`
**Risk:** Passive MITM can collect DKG randomness, QC signatures, validator metadata

- [ ] **Audit which HTTP endpoints need to remain public vs. move to HTTPS**
  - `/dkg/randomness/:block_number` → move to HTTPS
  - `/consensus/latest_ledger_info` → move to HTTPS
  - `/consensus/ledger_info/:epoch` → move to HTTPS
  - `/consensus/block/:epoch/:round` → move to HTTPS
  - `/consensus/qc/:epoch/:round` → move to HTTPS
  - `/consensus/validator_count/:epoch` → evaluate: move to HTTPS or keep public with explicit annotation

- [ ] **Move sensitive routes to `https_routes`**

- [ ] **Update client code (gravity_cli, e2e tests) to use HTTPS for these endpoints**

- [ ] **Update `testnet_deploy.md` and `testnet_join.md` to reflect HTTPS-only endpoints**

- [ ] **PR created and reviewed**
- [ ] **PR merged to `Galxe/gravity-sdk` main**

## 🔴 Critical — gravity-sdk (GSDK)

> Reference: [security-audit-gravity-sdk.md](./security-audit-gravity-sdk.md)

### GSDK-001 · Unauthenticated `/set_failpoint` on HTTP

**Repo:** `Galxe/gravity-sdk`
**File:** `crates/api/src/https/mod.rs:113`
**Risk:** Remote attacker injects failpoints into running validator, halting consensus

- [ ] **Choose fix strategy**
  - [ ] Option A: Move to `https_routes` + add token auth middleware (recommended)
  - [ ] Option B: Bind HTTP listener to `127.0.0.1` only
  - [ ] Option C: Gate behind `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` so unavailable in release

- [ ] **Implement chosen option**

- [ ] **Verify not accessible from external IP**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://<validator-external-ip>:8080/set_failpoint \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"name": "test", "action": "return"}'
  # Must return connection refused or 403
  ```

- [ ] **PR created and reviewed**
- [ ] **PR merged to `Galxe/gravity-sdk` main**

---

### GSDK-002 · Unauthenticated `/mem_prof` on HTTP

**Repo:** `Galxe/gravity-sdk`
**File:** `crates/api/src/https/mod.rs:114`
**Risk:** Attacker triggers heap dump; dump file may contain in-memory secrets

- [ ] **Move to HTTPS route with authentication (same options as GSDK-001)**
- [ ] **Ensure heap dump files are written with `0600` permissions**
- [ ] **Verify not accessible from external IP**
- [ ] **PR created, reviewed, merged**

---

## 🟡 Medium — gravity-sdk (GSDK)

### GSDK-003 · Consensus/DKG Endpoints on Plaintext HTTP

**Repo:** `Galxe/gravity-sdk`
**File:** `crates/api/src/https/mod.rs:105–112`
**Risk:** Passive MITM collects DKG randomness, QC signatures, epoch validator metadata

- [ ] **Move these routes to `https_routes` with TLS:**
  - `/dkg/randomness/:block_number`
  - `/consensus/latest_ledger_info`
  - `/consensus/ledger_info/:epoch`
  - `/consensus/block/:epoch/:round`
  - `/consensus/qc/:epoch/:round`
  - `/consensus/validator_count/:epoch` — evaluate: move to HTTPS or keep public

- [ ] **Update gravity_cli DKG subcommands to use HTTPS**

- [ ] **PR created, reviewed, merged**

---

### GSDK-004 · SSRF in Sentinel Probe URL

**Repo:** `Galxe/gravity-sdk`
**File:** `bin/sentinel/src/probe.rs:34`, `bin/sentinel/src/config.rs:14`
**Risk:** Compromised config causes sentinel to probe cloud metadata endpoints

- [ ] **Add URL validation at `Config::load()` time**
  - Reject non-http/https schemes
  - Block link-local (`169.254.0.0/16`), loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`), RFC 1918 private ranges
  - Return hard error and refuse to start on validation failure

- [ ] **Verify with test config containing `url = "http://169.254.169.254/"` — sentinel must refuse to start**

- [ ] **PR created, reviewed, merged**
